# T6-Survival
A MW3 inspired Gamemode. Back in the days i spend days in this Mode.
Then after Bo2 had his GSC breakthrough 10 Years or so ago i created an buggy shitty version of this.
Old Link: https://nextgenupdate.com/forums/black-ops-2-gsc-mods-scripts/807231-game-mode-survival-v14a.html

Now i got back into BO2 and completely rewrite from scratch.

This is ment to be played on Plutonium T6 Multiplayer.
I only give support for Server Mode but it should work on Private Game too.

No need to set any Dvars but you can set the Dvar for bot difficulty.

Upload on next Version.

# ToDo (Top to Bottom Prio)
```
-FIX: Ammo refill for both weapons (Disabled - causes weapon to lose Attachment)
