# T6-Survival
A MW3 inspired Gamemode. Back in the days i spend days in this Mode.
Then after Bo2 had his GSC breakthrough 10 Years or so ago i created an buggy shitty version of this.
Old Link: https://nextgenupdate.com/forums/black-ops-2-gsc-mods-scripts/807231-game-mode-survival-v14a.html

Now i got back into BO2 and completely rewrite from scratch.

This is ment to be played on Plutonium T6 Multiplayer.
I only give support for Server Mode but it should work on Private Game too.

No need to set any Dvars but you can set the Dvar for bot difficulty.

# Upload on next Version 1.5

# ToDo (Top to Bottom Prio)
```
FIX: -Round Respawn while whole intervall and not just on roundend
FIX IMPORTANT: _weapon.gsc exceeded maximum number of parent server script variables / need attachment checker max 3 and check for invalid combos (didnt wanted to do that sadly need to crashes server)
FIX: -buying health with damaged hp will add 100 on your current one
-Knife kills rewarded with $80 instead of normal $40
-Make Bosses look more like Bosses
-Perma V-Sat Killsteak
