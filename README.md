# T6-Survival
A MW3 inspired Gamemode. Back in the days i spend days in this Mode.
Then after Bo2 had his GSC breakthrough 10 Years or so ago i created an buggy shitty version of this.
Old Link: https://nextgenupdate.com/forums/black-ops-2-gsc-mods-scripts/807231-game-mode-survival-v14a.html

Now i got back into BO2 and completely rewrite from scratch.

This is ment to be played on Plutonium T6 Multiplayer.
I only give support for Server Mode but it should work on Private Game too.

No need to set any Dvars but you can set the Dvar for bot difficulty.

# Upload on next Version 1.5 (Current Game State):
```
After todays gamemode stress test im very happy with the current state. there were some random crashes (once every 3 rounds) except the following things: 
-maps/mp/gametypes/_weapon.gsc exceeded maximum number of parent server script variables
-maps/mp/gametypes/_battlechatter_mp.gsc: exceeded maximum number of parent server script variables

Quote form a Plutonium Staff:
Well the error means you ran out of child script variables. This happened because you have a child variable leak in one or multiple of your scripts.
Unfortunately this isn't an easy issue to fix but to help you can use fed's t6-gsc-utils and look at the child variables dump it produces in the minidumps folder when such as an error occurs.
This will give you an idea of what functions might be leaking child variables.
To fix this in these functions you need to either end the old threads if you are spawning new ones or you need to clear old variables that you aren't using by setting them to be undefined.

His answer on my question: 
When a player is kicked from the game or disconnects all of the variables directly attached to their script entity are removed. The scripts the error occurs in are meaningless.
This error does not happen in the stock game under normal conditions. The script the error says it happened in is just the last time a variable was attempted to be allocated and failed.
The error is in your code so read my previous comment on this post to debug this issue.

But in my case they come from basic game scriptfiles. Trying to do a workaround (maybe its because of bots kicking and respawning. idk if server "clears" the variables for bots when kicked. will be testet.)
