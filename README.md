# T6-Survival
A MW3 inspired Gamemode. Back in the days i spend days in this Mode.
Then after Bo2 had his GSC breakthrough 10 Years or so ago i created an buggy shitty version of this.
Old Link: https://nextgenupdate.com/forums/black-ops-2-gsc-mods-scripts/807231-game-mode-survival-v14a.html

Now i got back into BO2 and completely rewrite from scratch.

This is ment to be played on Plutonium T6 Multiplayer.
I only give support for Server Mode but it should work on Private Game too.

No need to set any Dvars but you can set the Dvar for bot difficulty.

# Upload on next Version 1.5 (Current Game State 5.09.2023 - Upload will be when the Variables Leak is fixxed):
```
Came into Game LImitations. I have a workaround. will implement it some times next week but currently my time is limited.
```

Old:
As it seems there are no variable leaks.
```
child var allocations where count > 1

total: 0, total calculated: 327
```
```
child var allocations where count > 1

Checking further now. Also made thread at [Plutonium](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/32144/exceeded-maximum-number-of-parent-server-script-variables):
You can post there or write me here if you have suggestions or the idea to fix.
